As of February 2024, I am a researcher in the [National Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/). I am interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy, with a focus on Decentralized Computing and Blockchain systems. I hold a MEng equivalent diploma from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). I was previouslty an intern at the [SPiDers](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/kokoris-group/) group at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/). For more information about me you can take a look at my [CV](https://galexo.github.io/files/CV-alexopoulos.pdf)
